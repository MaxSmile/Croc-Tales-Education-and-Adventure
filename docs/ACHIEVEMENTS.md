# CROC TALES: ACHIEVEMENTS

## Feature: Share Achievements with Croc-Themed Photo Frames

### 1. **Achievement Sharing**
When users unlock achievements, they should have the option to share them directly on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Each achievement could be represented as a unique image or badge, allowing users to proudly display their progress in the app.

**Key elements:**
- **Achievement Badges**: Unique, visually appealing badges for each milestone (e.g., “Visited 5 Crocs,” “Completed Crocwise Quiz”).
- **Social Media Integration**: Include built-in sharing buttons that link directly to the user's social media accounts.
- **Custom Messages**: Pre-fill a message with hashtags (e.g., #CrocTalesNT, #ExploreNT) that users can post along with their shared achievement.

### 2. **Croc-Themed Photo Frames**
Allow users to take or upload a photo and insert it into croc-themed photo frames, celebrating their visit to a specific location or completion of a quiz. This feature would be ideal for families, tourists, and adventurers who want to capture their NT journey and share it on social media.

**How it works:**
- **Take/Upload a Photo**: Users can take a photo directly from the app (using the device camera) or upload an existing image.
- **Croc-Themed Frames**: Provide several different frames, each themed around crocodiles or NT’s natural beauty. For instance:
   - A crocodile peeking out from the edge of the frame.
   - Frames representing famous landmarks (e.g., Kakadu, Litchfield) alongside a crocodile.
   - A “Crocwise Safety” frame for users completing the safety quiz.
- **Customizable Text**: Allow users to add text to the image, such as the location they visited or their achievement.
- **Download & Share**: Users can download the framed image and share it on social media directly from the app.

### 3. **Technical Approach**

- **Canvas API**: Use the HTML5 `Canvas` API for adding the photo frame around the user’s image.
- **Social Sharing API**: Integrate social media sharing capabilities with a package like `react-share` to make it easy for users to post their achievements or photos on different platforms.
- **Photo Editing Libraries**: Consider using libraries like `react-photo-editor` or `fabric.js` for adding frames and text to the user’s images.

### Sample Flow:

1. **User Unlocks Achievement**: After visiting a certain number of statues or completing a quiz, they are shown a badge with a “Share Your Achievement” button.
   
2. **Choose a Frame**: If they opt to take a photo, they can choose from a selection of croc-themed frames before snapping a picture or uploading one.

3. **Customize & Share**: They can add text, apply filters, and then share the photo directly to social media with pre-filled hashtags and captions, or save it to their device.

### Example Achievement Badge with Frame:

- Achievement: “You’ve Discovered 5 Croc Statues!”
- Croc Frame: Crocodile tail wrapping around the photo frame, with a scenic NT backdrop.
- Share Button: Users can share on social media with the hashtag #CrocTalesNT.

This feature would boost user engagement by making their experience more memorable and shareable, thus promoting the app and NT tourism through user-generated content.
